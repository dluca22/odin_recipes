        <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
        <p>Sous vide is a cooking technique that heats food with water. Here's how it works. Food is placed in a vacuum-sealed bag and cooked in a temperature-regulated water bath.</p>
        <p>The food cooks evenly because it is surrounded by water, not air. Because the water doesn't go above a certain temperature, you never have to worry about overcooked food</p>
        <p>In this recipe we'll teach you how to make an <strong><em>amazing</em></strong> and easy Chicken Cordon Bleu with just some minor preparation, that tastes amazing every single time</p>
        <p>Since sous vide is so simple, you can make <em>a lot of them</em> ahead, and being them already cooked and vacuum-sealed, you can either store them up to 7 days in your fridge, or up to 3 months in the freezer!</p>

              <li>Whole chicken breast</li>

        <h2>Finishing the dish</h2>
        <p>You can bread the cordon bleu and fry them up in some oil, or deep fry them</p>
        <p>Or you could also spare some extra calories and just grill them up in a bbq grill or a skillet</p>
