# odin_recipes

Started the final project of the HTML lesson in The Odin Project

Had to make a Recipe website with index page that link to 3 different recipes, each with an img, lists (ordered and unordered), and optional references to other sites
sarted at 19.40
finished at 23.30 (with 1 hour dinner break)

it went well, few minor mistakes but i committed to doing everything by hand and googling for resources and info

I went extra and added the Image Size refence, and it seemed to work in the end product, but HTML validator displays some sort of error i don't quite understand right now what and why
tried both absolute pixel resizing and percentage resizing.

i'll have to dig deeper in this area
